### What I'm doing now : 
In the last video, I have created migration, run the migration, created about 12 colomns, 
and made that table engine **MyIsam** to work very fast and smoothly. Created the blade from 
theme HTML and partiliazed, removed the extra **<tr>** from the *manage_leads* table. Now I'll
cycle through all the leads in the leads table.
